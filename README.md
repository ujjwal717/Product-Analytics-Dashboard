# Product-Analytics-Dashboard

Tools: SQL, Power BI

Situation

Analyzing and Monitoring each aspect of a SaaS startup is a bit challenging if you don’t have a centralized solution that is tailored as well for each aspect. The SaaS startup didn’t had a comprehensive yet tailored solution to track their product performance, customer behavior and Revenue related data.

Task

I was tasked with creating a Product Analytics Dashboard involving multiple report pages such as Executive Report, Revenue Report, Customer Analytics Report, and Product Analytics Report. The goal was to track and analyze each aspect in tailored and comprehensive manner to get best insight possible to grow our startup.

Action

I collaborated with the relevant teams including product, growth, and more to understand their problems, pain-points and their objective and decisions they want to make.

Then cleaned and preprocessed the data in SQL and conducted EDA to understand patterns in the data.

After that, I connected SQL with Power BI to build tailored report pages including Executive Report, Revenue Report, Customer Analytics Report, and Product Analytics Report.

Included relevant KPIs, Metrics, and Visuals along with relevant slicers to see granular data according to need.

Result

The dashboard was developed on time, focusing on key metrics and KPIs relevant to each report page scope.

It demonstrated how each product, segment, industry, and country is performing in terms of product usage, revenue, customer behavior and so much more.

It also pointed out prompt actionable insights such as upcoming renewals so that team can reach out to them.
